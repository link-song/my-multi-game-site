  "description": "Have you ever heard of a game called Skibidi Toilet io?  It's a rather absurd concept - a battle royale game where toilets run around like crazy.  The aim of the game is for the toilets to compete with each other by eating as much toilet paper and hot peppers as possible.  As they consume more, they become bigger and stronger.",
