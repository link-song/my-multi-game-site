  "description": "In the ocean of shoot-'em-all games, finding an online shooter that meets your console gamer expectations can feel impossible.  After playing legends like Counter-Strike or Far Cry, other online FPS games may seem bland, lacking an immersive story.  But believe it or not, WarStrike will give you the taste of playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, all from the comfort of your browser. \nWarStrike's campaign mode takes you deep into a critical mission as an elite MI-6 Special Soldier.",
