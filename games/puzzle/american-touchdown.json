  "description": "American Touchdown is a 2 player ball game where you try to carry the ball to the opponent's side.  If the ball is in your opponent's hand, you need to carefully approach him and take it from his hand.  Of course, your hands must be in a suitable position to receive the ball.  This match will be fascinating!",
