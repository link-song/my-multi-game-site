  "description": "Draw the Car Path is an online puzzle game where you guide cars to their parking spots by drawing their paths.  It sounds simple, but as you progress, the difficulty of solving the tangled cars increases.  You'll start with a single car in an empty parking lot, but soon, you'll have to manage multiple vehicles, all while making sure they donâ€™t crash into each other or the walls.  With 30 levels to complete, strategic thinking and precise drawing skills will be your best buddies!",
