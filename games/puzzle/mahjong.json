  "description": "Mahjong Online is a game of patience, skill, and a bit of luck.  In this version of a decades-old game, your goal will be to match identical tiles to remove them from the board until none remain.  The difficulty comes with this rule: only free tiles can be picked.  So, blocked tiles must be open on at least one side.",
