  "description": "Moto Trials is a 3D driving game where players try to engage with the ramps and obstacles on the platform.  Here, the player's ability to control the motor will be tested to the utmost.  As the levels progress, the platform will become increasingly difficult.  Reflexes and hand-eye coordination are also of great importance because there will be places on the platform where the player must suddenly change direction.",
